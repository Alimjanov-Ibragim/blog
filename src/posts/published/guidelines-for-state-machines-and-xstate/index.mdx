### Intro

This exists as a living document to define some guidelines regarding state machines and their usage. They are by no means exhaustive, but hopefully set you on the right path. It is _highly recommended_ that you read the [XState docs](https://xstate.js.org/docs) for more information.

### What is a State Machine?

A state machine, more specifically a _finite_ state machine, is means of representing all the possible enumerated states of a system and the enumerated possible transitions between states in that system. Let's use a brief example to gain some insight.

Consider a light bulb. A light bulb typically has two states: `lit` and `unlit`. We might be tempted to define this as a boolean, but this will lead to problems shortly. Let's instead define these two states as objects.

```javascript
const lit = {}
const unlit = {}

const states = {
  lit,
  unlit
}
```

Next, let's define the possible transitions of these states to the other states. I will follow the conventions of the XState library, so as to introduce the API.

```javascript
const lit = {
  on: { TURN_OFF: 'unlit' }
}
const unlit = {
  on: { TURN_ON: 'lit' }
}
```

We define "events" on the `on` property of a state node in XState (and by convention, they are in scream case ðŸ˜±). States respond to these events. In this case, if an event of `type: 'TURN_OFF'` is sent to the machine, only when we are in the `lit` state will we respond to it. Sending the `TURN_OFF` event to a light bulb that's already off will do nothing.

Let's combine this all together into an actual XState machine. Machine's receive an `id`, an `initial` state, and a `states` object of the enumerated state nodes.

```javascript
import { Machine } from 'xstate'

const lit = {
  on: { TURN_OFF: 'unlit' }
}

const unlit = {
  on: { TURN_ON: 'lit' }
}

const states = {
  lit,
  unlit
}

const lightBulbMachine = Machine({
  id: 'lightBulb',
  initial: 'unlit',
  states
})
```

Let's move our `lit` and `unlit` states directly into the `Machine` config object to tidy this up:

```javascript
import { Machine } from 'xstate'

const lightBulbMachine = Machine({
  id: 'lightBulb',
  initial: 'unlit',
  states: {
    lit: {
      on: { TURN_OFF: 'unlit' }
    },
    unlit: {
      on: { TURN_ON: 'lit' }
    }
  }
})
```

Every machine has a `transition` method, which receives a `state` and an `event` and returns the next state. _This is very similar to a reducer for Flux or Redux_.

```javascript
lightBulbMachine.transition('lit', 'TURN_OFF') // 'unlit'
lightBulbMachine.transition('unlit', 'TURN_OFF') // 'unlit'
lightBulbMachine.transition('unlit', 'TURN_ON') // 'lit'
```

### Why Booleans are a Misguided Approach

Extending our light bulb example, one might realize that there is a _third_ state that a light bulb can be in: `broken`.

A `broken` light bulb is technically `unlit`, but it's a different kind of `unlit` and deserving of its own state. If we tried to cover the two states with booleans, we'll discover a problem. If we enumerate all the permutations of just two booleans, we'll find that it comes out to 4 states.

| isLit | isBroken |
| ----- | -------- |
| false | false    |
| false | true     |
| true  | false    |
| true  | true     |

There exists the possibility in our code for the existence of an "impossible state", where the light bulb is both `isLit && isBroken`.

Now, we're typically decent programmers and can code around this, but as we start to add booleans to manage state, that explosion of possibility continues at the pace of `2^n` where `n` is the number of states controlled by a boolean. Iterate on that just a few times and you can see how quickly all the permutations grow: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, etc.

State machines avoid this problem by forcing us to enumerate only the possible states, which more accurately models what we are trying to achieve anyways. Making our light bulb is as simple as adding a new state node and some events to respond to.

```javascript
import { Machine } from 'xstate'

const lightBulbMachine = Machine({
  id: 'lightBulb',
  initial: 'unlit',
  states: {
    lit: {
      on: {
        TURN_OFF: 'unlit',
        BREAK: 'broken'
      }
    },
    unlit: {
      on: {
        TURN_ON: 'lit',
        BREAK: 'broken'
      }
    },
    broken: {
      type: 'final'
    }
  }
})
```

For a bonus touch, we add the `type: 'final` to the `broken` state. This signals that the machine cannot transition into any other states, and has utility when a machine is used as a service for another machine.

### Side Effects with State Machines

State machines respond to events. Events may or may not trigger a transition. As a result of transitions, we have the opportunity to produce side effects. These side effects are called "actions".

We can call actions at three moments in that state transition cycle, and they happen in this order.

- on `exit` from a state
- on the transition to a state
- on `entry` to a state

Let's fire actions of each kind in our light bulb example.

```javascript
import { Machine } from 'xstate'

const breakEvent = {
  BREAK: {
    // BREAK: 'broken' is a shorthand for BREAK: { target: 'broken' }
    target: 'broken',
    actions: ['informUserOfBrokeLightBulb']
  }
}

const lightBulbMachine = Machine(
  {
    id: 'lightBulb',
    initial: 'unlit',
    states: {
      lit: {
        entry: 'enterLit', // If only a single action is taken, a string will suffice
        on: {
          TURN_OFF: 'unlit',
          BREAK: 'broken'
        }
      },
      unlit: {
        exit: ['leaveUnlit'],
        on: {
          TURN_ON: 'lit',
          BREAK: 'broken'
        }
      },
      broken: {
        type: 'final'
      }
    }
  },
  {
    actions: {
      // all actions receive the machine's `context` and the `event` that triggered the action.
      // More on context later
      enterLit: (context, event) => {
        console.log(`Light bulb lit from ${JSON.stringify(event)}`)
      },
      leaveUnlit: () => {
        console.log('We can do more than log stuff, this is just an example')
      },
      informUserOfBrokeLightBulb: (_, event) => {
        // we can put more information on an event object, such as
        // { type: 'BREAK', bulbId: 'someUUIDOrSomething' }
        contactUserAboutBrokenBulb(event.bulbId)
      }
    }
  }
)
```

You _can_ write functions inline in `actions` or `entry` or `exit`, **however**, it is recommended that you write the as strings and configure them in the `options` argument of `Machine()` This will be _especially_ useful when we start combining XState and React.

### Context in State Machines

`context` has a different meaning in state machines than it does in React. In React, `context` is a state held in closure to be referenced by many components via a providing and consuming component architecture. It is used to avoid excessive "prop drilling" among other things.

In state machines, `context` is used to store data that cannot be easily represented by finite states. In fact, it is most often used to keep track of _infinite_ states.

Consider a text input. There exists an infinite number of strings that could be used as the `value` of that input. It therefore would require an infinite number of states to model that system. This is simply impossible.

That said, occasionally we need values that result in infinite states in order to accomplish a variety of tasks. Thus, `context` in state machines.

Think of `context` in a state machine similar to how you think of `state` in React. It is localized to the machine. It can be updated when necessary and can be referenced by the machine.

`context` is added as a `context` object on the `config` object of a machine. Let's take our light bulb example and add a `color` to it in context.

```javascript
import { Machine } from 'xstate'

const lightBulbMachine = Machine({
  id: 'lightBulb',
  initial: 'unlit',
  // We'll add `context` here
  context: {
    color: '#fff'
  },
  states: {
    lit: {
      on: {
        TURN_OFF: 'unlit',
        BREAK: 'broken'
      }
    },
    unlit: {
      on: {
        TURN_ON: 'lit',
        BREAK: 'broken'
      }
    },
    broken: {
      type: 'final'
    }
  }
})
```

We've added `color` to context. Now, let's create an event to update the `color`.

```javascript
import { assign, Machine } from 'xstate'

const lightBulbMachine = Machine(
  {
    id: 'lightBulb',
    initial: 'unlit',
    // We'll add `context` here
    context: {
      color: '#fff'
    },
    states: {
      lit: {
        on: {
          CHANGE_COLOR: {
            actions: ['updateColor']
          },
          TURN_OFF: 'unlit',
          BREAK: 'broken'
        }
      },
      unlit: {
        on: {
          CHANGE_COLOR: {
            actions: ['updateColor']
          },
          TURN_ON: 'lit',
          BREAK: 'broken'
        }
      },
      broken: {
        type: 'final'
      }
    }
  },
  {
    actions: {
      updateColor: assign((context, event) => ({
        color: event.color
      }))
    }
  }
)
```

We've added a `CHANGE_COLOR` event to the `lit` and `unlit` states. We can send a `color` value along with our event to trigger an `assign`. `assign` is a special action creator function for XState used to update `context`. It works very similar to React's `setState`. It can take an object for the next state, or an updater function as we have above in the code. The updater function should return an object of the `context` changes.

```javascript
const nextState = lightBulbMachine.transition('lit', {
  type: 'CHANGE_COLOR',
  color: '#f00'
}) // { value: 'lit', context: { color: '#f00' } }
```

Take notice that we have an event that _only_ triggers actions. It does not have a `target` state. This is useful when we want to respond to events in a state without making a state transition.

### Function Components & Hooks

The `@xstate/react` package ships a very useful hook, `useMachine`. `useMachine` accepts a `Machine` as its first argument and an `options` object as its second object. In this way, we're able to create a machine that defines our component's enumerated states and transitions, but use any props or functions in the component within the `options` object.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import {Machine} from 'xstate'
import {useMachine} from '@xstate/react'

const lightBulbMachine = Machine({
  id: 'lightBulb',
  initial: 'unlit',
  states: {
    lit: {
      on: {
        TURN_OFF: 'unlit',
        BREAK: 'broken'
      }
    },
    unlit: {
      on: {
        TURN_ON: 'lit',
        BREAK: 'broken'
      }
    },
    broken: {
      type: 'final'
      entry: ['logBroken']
    }
  }
})

const TEXTS_BY_STATE = {
  lit: 'LIGHT!',
  unlit: 'not light',
  broken: 'so borked'
}

function LightBulb({ id }) {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(lightBulbMachine, {
    actions: {
      logBroken: () => {
        console.log(`Light bulb with id: ${id} has broken`)
      }
    }
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {TEXTS_BY_STATE[state.value]}
      <div>
        <button onClick={() => send('TURN_ON')} type="button">Turn On</button>
        <button onClick={() => send('TURN_OFF')} type="button">Turn Off</button>
        <button onClick={() => send('BREAK')} type="button">Break</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

In the above example, we render all of the buttons regardless of what `state.value` is. We can disable buttons based on the current state with `state.matches()`.

`state.matches()` accepts a string or object representing a state and returns a boolean regarding if it matches or not. We can use it like this:

```javascript
return (
  <div>
    {TEXTS_BY_STATE[state.value]}
    <div>
      <button
        disabled={state.matches('lit')}
        onClick={() => send('TURN_ON')}
        type="button"
      >
        Turn On
      </button>
      <button
        disabled={state.matches('unlit')}
        onClick={() => send('TURN_OFF')}
        type="button"
      >
        Turn Off
      </button>
      <button
        disabled={state.matches('broken')}
        onClick={() => send('BREAK')}
        type="button"
      >
        Break
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
)
```

We can extrapolate this API, the use of `state.value` and `state.matches()` to handle all condition based rendering and functionality in our components and more.

### Class Components

It is possible to use XState with class components as well, but this will require a few extra steps and a new concept. The concept first.

A state machine, specifically the `transition` method on a machine, is a pure function. We give it a `state` and an `event` (and we can supply a `context` as the third argument) and we should get the same next state every time. Being pure means that the machine itself does not store the current state. Instead, we are responsible for that. We can accomplish this through using a `service`.

A `service` is used to maintain the current state. We also `send` events to the `service` (hence where `send` comes from with the `useMachine` hook) which are passed along the machine's `transition` method internally. We can start a service by using the `interpret` function from XState. Let's write our light bulb component as a class component.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import {Machine, interpret} from 'xstate'

const lightBulbMachine = Machine({
  id: 'lightBulb',
  initial: 'unlit',
  states: {
    lit: {
      on: {
        TURN_OFF: 'unlit',
        BREAK: 'broken'
      }
    },
    unlit: {
      on: {
        TURN_ON: 'lit',
        BREAK: 'broken'
      }
    },
    broken: {
      type: 'final'
      entry: ['logBroken']
    }
  }
})

const TEXTS_BY_STATE = {
  lit: 'LIGHT!',
  unlit: 'not light',
  broken: 'so borked'
}

class LightBulb extends React.Component {
  state = {
    current: lightBulbMachine.initialState
  }

  config = {
    actions: {
      logBroken: () => {
        console.log(`Light bulb with id: ${id} has broken`)
      }
    }
  }

  service = interpret(lightBulbMachine.withConfig(this.config))
    .onTransition(current => {
      this.setState({ current })
    })

  componentDidMount() {
    this.service.start()
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.service.stop()
  }

  render() {
    const { current } = this.state
    const { send } = this.service

    return (
      <div>
        {TEXTS_BY_STATE[current.value]}
        <div>
          <button onClick={() => send('TURN_ON')} type="button">Turn On</button>
          <button onClick={() => send('TURN_OFF')} type="button">Turn Off</button>
          <button onClick={() => send('BREAK')} type="button">Break</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

I want you to take notice of a few key things:

1. We need to `start` and `stop` our service. This is because in complex state machines, there `activities` and long running side effects that depend on these methods being called.
2. We can configure our state machine with local `props` and methods, but we must do so by extending the machine using the `withConfig` method. This is different than the `useMachine` hook, where we could supply a second argument to the function instead.
3. We store the `current` state in local React state. We use the `service`'s `onTransition` method to keep state in sync in our component.

While it is more code, it does mean that state machines can be introduced to legacy components without the need to update them to function components that can use the `useMachine` hook.

### Complex Machines

Thus far, our state machines have been relatively simple. They have been one level of states and one single system of states. At some point, it is likely you'll need something more complex. It is highly recommended you read the XState docs for a deep dive on more complex machines, but two common ones will be covered here: Hierarchical and Parallel machines.

#### Hierarchical Machines

As you're developing a machine, you may realize that some of your enumerated states are really _child states of a parent state_. Let's extend our light bulb example further.

Our light bulb has a new feature, it can shine at three different levels of brightness: `low`, `normal`, and `high`. These states are child states (or "substates") of our `lit` state. Let's write a hierarchical state machine to convey this.

```javascript
import { Machine } from 'xstate'

const lightBulbMachine = Machine({
  id: 'lightBulb',
  initial: 'unlit',
  states: {
    lit: {
      // Child states start here
      initial: 'normal',
      states: {
        low: {
          on: {
            INCREASE_BRIGHTNESS: 'normal'
          }
        },
        normal: {
          on: {
            DECREASE_BRIGHTNESS: 'low',
            INCREASE_BRIGHTNESS: 'high'
          }
        },
        high: {
          on: {
            DECREASE_BRIGHTNESS: 'normal'
          }
        }
      },
      // Child states end here
      on: {
        TURN_OFF: 'unlit',
        BREAK: 'broken'
      }
    },
    unlit: {
      on: {
        TURN_ON: 'lit',
        BREAK: 'broken'
      }
    },
    broken: {
      type: 'final'
    }
  }
})
```

To create a hierarchical machine, we essentially create the same structure as a normal state machine, but nest it in the parent state. We add an `initial` state, and enumerate the child states under the `states` property.

Now if our light bulb is in the `lit` state, it will initially start in the `{ lit: 'normal' }` state. We can send events to our machine to change the brightness.

```javascript
lightBulbMachine({ lit: 'normal' }, 'INCREASE_BRIGHTNESS') // { lit: 'high' }
lightBulbMachine({ lit: 'high' }, 'DECREASE_BRIGHTNESS') // { lit: 'normal' }
```

Hiearchical states are an excellent way to model states that should only exist as a child state of another state. This allows us to avoid a lot of conditional logic since our machine won't respond to events unless it is in the correct state.

#### Parallel Machines

Occasionally, you'll find your model requires a machine be in multiple states simultaneously. This is what a parallel machine is for. A parallel machine allows a machine to be in multiple states simultaneously and independently. Let's extend our light bulb further and turn it into one for the dance floor. Lights on the dance floor flash in various patterns, and they can oscillate in different ways. We'll focus on just those two parallel states in our example (which will also include a hierarchical state since these can only occur in the `lit` state).

```javascript
import { Machine } from 'xstate'

const lightBulbMachine = Machine({
  id: 'lightBulb',
  initial: 'unlit',
  states: {
    lit: {
      // parallel child states start here
      type: 'parallel', // no initial state, requires `type: 'parallel'` be set
      states: {
        // 1st parallel state
        pattern: {
          // We can easily have hiearchical child states inside our parent parallel state
          initial: 'steady',
          states: {
            steady: {
              on: {
                PULSE: 'pulsing',
                FLASH: 'flashing'
              }
            },
            pulsing: {
              on: {
                STEADY: 'steady',
                FLASH: 'flashing'
              }
            },
            flashing: {
              on: {
                STEADY: 'steady',
                PULSE: 'pulsing'
              }
            }
          }
        },
        // 2nd parallel state
        movement: {
          initial: 'stationary',
          states: {
            stationary: {
              on: { OSCILLATE: 'oscillating' }
            },
            oscillating: {
              on: { STOP: 'stationary' }
            }
          }
        }
      },
      // parallel child states end here
      on: {
        TURN_OFF: 'unlit',
        BREAK: 'broken'
      }
    },
    unlit: {
      on: {
        TURN_ON: 'lit',
        BREAK: 'broken'
      }
    },
    broken: {
      type: 'final'
    }
  }
})
```

We added quite a bit of complexity here, but it's just the combination of parallel and hierarchical states that make it happen. Let's break it down.

Under the `lit` state, we add a couple parallel states: one for the light `pattern` and one for the `movement` of the bulb. The bulb is in both states simultaneously and independently. We can send events that affect one without affecting the other.

Next, inside of each parallel state, we've added a hierarchical state chart to govern the states held within each parallel state. This is precisely what we've seen thus far. We have a subchart that controls the `pattern` states, and one that governs the `movement` states.

If we were to examine the value returned by the `lit` state, it would initially look like this:

```javascript
lightBulbMachine.transition('unlit', 'TURN_ON')
// {
//   value: {
//     lit: {
//       pattern: 'steady',
//       movement: 'stationary',
//     }
//   }
// }
```

Notice that the `lit` state is an object with the states of all our parallel states contained within.

### Visualizing State Machines

XState has a very handy visualizer at [xstate.js.org/viz](xstate.js.org./viz). You can save machines as gists from the visualizer as well.

### How to Approach Creating a State Machine

Here is a general heuristic of how to approach creating a state machine.

1. Enumerate the states of your program
2. Enumerate the transitions between those states
3. Examine if any of the states can only exist as a substate of another state. If so, know you can use a hierachical state machine.
4. Examine if any of the states can exist simultaneously and independently. If so, know you can use a parallel state machine.
5. Create objects for all of your states
6. Add the transitions to the `on` property of those states
7. Combine these into the `states` property of your machine
8. Add the `initial` state to your machine
9. Add an `id` to your machine
10. Start the service of your machine through either `interpret` or `useMachine` depending on your situation.
11. Profit.

### Testing

Tests can be written just as any other test would be written regarding UI interactions to verify expected behavior.

There is also the `@xstate/test` library that can _automatically generate all possible branches of your state machine_. More will be added to this section in the future.
