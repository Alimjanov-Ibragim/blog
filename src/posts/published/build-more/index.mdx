I was chatting with a friend recently who lamented they didn't have time to do "fun things". They felt the need to spend all their free time learning more about programming. Learning more can help you make progress in your career, but learning is only part of the process. There's a more effective path to progress (and learning), and I smacked them on the head with it, just as I'm about to smack you.

"Yeah. You're learning a lot. But what are you **building**?"

"Oh... nothing."
