```javascript
const compose = (...fns) => x => fns.reduceRight((acc, fn) => fn(acc), x)

const pipe = (...fns) => x => fns.reduce((acc, fn) => fn(acc), x)
```

If you want to get real fancy, you can split out and share the reducer.

```javascript
const apply = (value, fn) => fn(value)

const compose = (...fns) => x => fns.reduceRight(apply, x)

const pipe = (...fns) => x => fns.reduce(apply, x)
```
