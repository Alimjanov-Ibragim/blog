I have been ruminating on the topic of this post for quite some time now. However, don't take the longevity of my rumination as a sign of any brilliance to come. This is an exploration of my thoughts on it, not a definitive set of insights or answers to the problem I see. I am hoping that the discussion that follows this post might create some good in the world.

Let's set out some facts that will be pertinent to the discussion at hand. At the time I am writing this, I am 34 years old. I started programming later than quite a few, so I have only been programming professionally for 6 years. I currently am a senior software engineer. Take that for what you will. Let's crunch some numbers with these facts established.

As of this moment, I have no intentions (nor ability) to retire early. Assuming I work until I am 65, I have 31 more years to work. That means, thus far, I have only worked 16% of my career. I'm barely getting started. But this poses a lot of questions.

At 34, I know a cohort of devs who are roughly my age, but very few who are significantly older than I am. I know they exist, but I just don't happen to know more than a handful.

What I suspect to be the primary reason for this is that the industry itself is quite young. Sure, software has been around for some time, but the Internet has only exists for a little over 25 years. A college student who started building websites since day one would be in the late 40s to mid 50s by now. That's really not that long ago. Even they would have over half of their career to go.

All of this has me thinking about what happens to me in 20 years? This question legitimately has me nervous.

To some degree, I already feel like I'm pushing the limits of what I can be as an engineer. I
