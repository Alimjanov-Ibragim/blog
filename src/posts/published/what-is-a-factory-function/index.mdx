Building upon [closures](/what-is-a-closure), I want to teach you about "factory functions" next. Many factory functions use closures, and therefore, it is quite useful to learn of them together, so if you haven't read that post, you may want to do so first.

A **factory function** is a function that creates objects. At a fundamental level, _that's it_. But there's a lot more to it and the implications are interesting, especially for JavaScript.
