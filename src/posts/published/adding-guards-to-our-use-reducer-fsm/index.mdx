The next part in our `useReducer` finite state machine journey is adding "guards". If you haven't read the previous posts in this collection, I encourage you to do so before reading ahead. Those posts are:

- [How to Use `useReducer` as a Finite State Machine](/how-to-use-usereducer-as-a-finite-state-machine)
- [Adding Infinite States to a `useReducer` Finite State Machine](/adding-infinite-states-to-a-use-reducer-finite-state-machine)

A "guard" is a predicate function <Marker content="A function that returns a boolean." /> used to conditionally determine if a state transition should happen. In simpler terms, if the guard function returns `true`, take the transition, otherwise do not.
