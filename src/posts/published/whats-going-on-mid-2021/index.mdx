**Disclaimer**: This post will not be published forever. What I will share here is not the kind of content I believe belongs long term on my blog. I will be archiving it at the end of July 2021.

A lot has happened for me in the first half of 2021 and I need to take a moment to try and process some of that. I tend to get stuck in thought-loops when I keep things to myself, so this post is my attempt at externally processing what has transpired so far.

### What happened at Webflow?

I left Webflow at the end of February. Up til now, only people within the company, and a very small group of people outside of the company know exactly _why_.

To understand the full context of the situation, it's important to understand what I was doing in 2020. I spent all of 2020 working as the only developer on a key feature for our users. <Marker content="I was given the task with the intention of having the opportunity to lead other engineers in making the improvements, but was then never provided other engineers, and thus, did all the work myself." /> I was tasked with updating and revamping Webflow's Assets tab. I'm proud of the improvements I made to that feature. I hope the users are happy as well. I did my best.

I was getting burned out and depressed about the project. I was lonely, grinding away at something that I didn't really have any interest in. I just don't care about assets. Have you ever noticed how sparse I am with them here? That's on purpose.

As "reward" for my efforts, bringing a major revamp to a user requested feature all by myself, I was told in November 2020 that I was being reorganized and moved to the Growth team at the start of 2021. **This left a huge pit in my stomach.**

The goals and purpose of the Growth team do not align at all with my principles and interests. <Marker content={`I would go into more detail, but I don't really feel like arguing about what essentially comes down to, "I'm different than you and care about different things," so I won't.`} /> I knew this, and I immediately made it clear to management that I did not want to join this team. Further still, there were other teams at Webflow that needed headcount that were more closely aligned with my interests. I asked that I get moved to there. I was told that wouldn't be possible. I was told that I should see this move to Growth as positive, that the company trusts something so important to their 5 key goals to me. That's not how I felt about it at at all.

I tried to keep my head up, but I knew that the work that was coming my way was going to depress me further, the depth and length of which was fundamentally unknowable. These unknown pains I knew were coming manifested in a lot of anxiety and depression. It got so bad that I started hearing things at night while I slept, frequently jumping out of bed because I thought people were breaking in. I was screaming in my dreams as I was fighting to be heard and listened to. It was very stressful.

Soon enough, 2021 came around and I was moved to the Growth team. I can remember distinctly being in my first meeting with the team, being asked what I was excited about and flatly telling everyone the truth, "I am not excited. I do not want to be on this team. I requested to be moved the moment I was told I would be joining this team because this work does not align with my principles or goals. I was denied."

Let me tell you, people don't have a clue what to do when you tell them the truth.

I was given an assignment, some onboarding feature that I didn't think much of and I tried my best to work. I couldn't muster shit, though. All this talk about "moving the needle" and "seeing a lift" was just bullshit to my ears. It wasn't a critical look at the data, it was number-seeking behavior with no grander vision of what was happening. I hated every moment of it. I dreaded work. My productivity ground to a halt.

All this time, I was still asking to be moved. That I knew I couldn't keep this up, I needed to do something I found more interesting and important. That I was depressed. I kept getting told, "The fastest we can move you is July." Do you know how painful it is to hear someone say, "I know you've been depressed for 3 months about this, and you're just going to have to continue feeling that way for another 5-6 months." It's demoralizing. Utterly demoralizing.

I didn't _want_ to leave Webflow. It was the best job I had had in my career. I enjoyed so many of my colleagues. I felt pretty good about the company as a whole. It was going reasonably well for 2 years and then this happened.

**Just what the fuck are you supposed to do when you're told that your input doesn't matter and we don't care if you're depressed, that you need to keep going?**

I did the only thing I could think to do. Start looking for escape hatches.

I wasn't in any mental state to go through the rigamarole of tech interviewing, but I got lucky. A few good friends were working at a small startup and wanted me to come on board. A few conversations later, and I was on to working for Murmur.
