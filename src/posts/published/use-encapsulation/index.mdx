Recently, I shared this tweet:

This tweet was my response to some refactoring of our codebase, but having a month now practice this a few more times, I'm convinced this pattern is the right way to go. I'll go further and say **most uses of React hooks should be encapsulated in a custom hook**. I'll save some of those examples for other posts I want to write soon, but for today, let's explore this pattern in regards to `useEffect`. Let's dive in.

### What is &ldquo;encapsulation&rdquo;?

To me, "encapsulation" is the act of taking all the details related to a _concern_ and wrapping them up into one structure. The most common structure I use is a function, but you can also think of modules, classes, and objects as being structures for encapsulation given the right context.

It's _really_ easy to leave the details of a concern strewn about your code. So easy you won't even realize that's what you're doing.
