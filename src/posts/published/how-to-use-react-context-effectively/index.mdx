React Context has always been a somewhat controversial tool. It was an experimental API for the longest time, but was made a standard API eventually. Now with React Hooks, React Context is easier to use than ever, but that also makes it easy to use poorly. In this post, I want to go over how I personally use React Context.

Before diving in, I want to make a distinction that's important to my mental model of Context. On its own, React Context is **not** a state management tool. React Context is a **wormhole** tool. It allows you to pass data from Point A to Point Z without passing it through all the points inbetween (aka prop drilling). That's always been the point. Yet, React Context can be _combined_ with state management <Marker content="Even regular ol' <code>React.useState</code> will suffice." /> to create a useful state management system.

### Think locally before globally

I personally do not like to think of React Context as an alternative global store. It can be used that way, but Contexts should be related to a single concern in my opinion. Therefore, I find I use Context more often when working on a localized concern, such as a complex feature on a single page of an app.

It is possible to use globally, but you should at least pause before you do and consider if there's an alternative that might be more useful for your situation. If there is not, then that's fine. Don't sweat it and proceed with Context.

As we'll discuss soon, React Context can lead to a lot of rerenders if the data passed to the `value` prop changes frequently. If I must use a Context Provider at a high level in the tree, such as a `ThemeProvider`, I want to make sure this component does not change `value` often so that my app performs well.

### Always export your own `Provider`

I cannot remember a single time in my years of writing React where there was a good reason for me _not_ to create a custom `Provider` for a context. I do this like so:

```jsx
// You can supply a default context here
// You may need to in order to satisfy type checkers
const MyContext = React.createContext()

export function MyProvider({ children }) {
  // We will add an actual `value` here later
  return <MyContext.Provider value={null}>{children}</MyContext.Provider>
}
```

Why do I do this? I do this so that I have full control over `value`. I do not want to give users of my `Provider` options that I do not explicitly control. I can give them props that will allow them to alter whatever `value` is eventually set to, but I am still in control. This prevents a number of future problems and encapsulates the concerns of the Context well.

### Create a custom hook for your context

There was a short window of time where we needed to use the `Context.Consumer` render prop pattern, but I haven't used it since React Hooks made consuming context significantly easier.

Rather than pass my Context object around and passing it into `React.useContext` in ever component I need it, I instead export a custom hook from the same file I create the Context, like so:

```javascript
export const useMyContext = () => React.useContext(MyContext)
```

Now, any component that needs this Context can import `useMyContext` and use it.

### Optimize components that consume your custom hook

From the React docs:

> All consumers that are descendants of a Provider will re-render whenever the Providerâ€™s `value` prop changes.

Remember that quote. All Consumers rerender when the Provider updates, _regardless of whether it is necessary or not_. This means, if you're not careful, you could be causing a lot of unnecessary rerenders in your application. We are responsible for preventing unnecessary rerenders, so how do we do this for components that consume a context?

There are primarily two ways to accomplish. Both use memoization but in different ways.

The first way is to turn the component that consumes the context into a "container component" and to use `React.memo` on the "presentational component" that the container returns. Like so:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { useAuthContext } from './AuthContext'

export function HeaderContainer({ children }) {
  const [authState, { logIn, logOut }] = useAuthContext()

  return <Header authState={authState} logIn={logIn} logOut={logOut} />
}

const Header = React.memo(function Header({ authState, logIn, logOut }) {
  return (
    <header>
      <nav />
      {authState === 'loggedIn' && <LogoutButton onClick={logOut} />}
      {authState === 'loggedOut' && <LoginButton onClick={logIn} />}
    </header>
  )
})
```

This works because we turn the `value` of the context into props passed to a memoized component. The memoized component only updates if the props change.

The second technique does not require an extra component, but instead uses `React.useMemo` to memoize what we return from the component that consumes the context. Like so:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { useAuthContext } from './AuthContext'

function Header({ authState, logIn, logOut }) {
  const [authState, { logIn, logOut }] = useAuthContext()

  return React.useMemo(
    () => (
      <header>
        <nav />
        {authState === 'loggedIn' && <LogoutButton onClick={logOut} />}
        {authState === 'loggedOut' && <LoginButton onClick={logIn} />}
      </header>
    ),
    [authState, logIn, logOut]
  )
}
```

This strategy works by memoizing the return value of our component, only recalculating it when one of our `auth` related values changes.
