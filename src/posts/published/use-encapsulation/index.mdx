Recently, I shared this tweet:

This tweet was my response to some refactoring of our codebase, but having more than a month now to practice this a few more times, I'm convinced this pattern is the right way to go. I'll go further and say **most uses of React hooks should be encapsulated in a custom hook**, and I'm going to try and convince you of that on this post.

Before we get started, it will benefit you greatly if you read my post on [encapsulation](/encapsulation) first. In that post, I argue that the primary purpose of a function is to encapuslate all the elements of a concern together into a single structure. We're going to apply this pattern to how we work with React Hooks.

### The Problem

Your code is strewn about.

### Why Custom Hooks are the Solution

A custom hook encapsulates the elements of your concern in one place and exposes an API.

### How to Enforce this Pattern

I wrote this eslint plugin: `eslint-plugin-prefer-custom-hooks`

### Summary

By opting to write all the hooks consumed by your components as custom ones, you will be providing future devs (including yourself) useful context by encapsulating all the pieces of a concern into a single function. By doing this, you gain all the benefits of proper encapsulation and make your components more declarative.
